        <h4>Previous Experience</h4>
        <p>
            Starting in 2009, Mr. Pennington used his vaunted RiskSim analytics suite to implement a proprietary risk and analytics 
            system at GoldenTree Asset Management and created a macro portfolio hedging overlay to manage the risk profile of its hedge funds.  
            Prior to that, he was a co-founder and Managing Parter at Rock Ridge 
            Advisors, ran money for Caxton Relative Value Holdings, and co-founded Convergence
            Asset Management.  He began his career in 1986 at Salomon Brothers in the firm's renowned fixed-income proprietary
            trading unit.  Mr. Pennington recieved his B.S. in Mathematics from Baylor University where 
            he was the University's Highest Ranking Student and an M.B.A. from the University of Chicago where
            he completed all of the requirements for a Ph.D. in Finance and Statistics except for a dissertation.

            The mind is its own place, and in itself can make a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven.

            By making a conscious decision to "make heaven of hell" and sloughing off adversity 
            and criticism like "water off the back of a duck", you can weather any storm.
