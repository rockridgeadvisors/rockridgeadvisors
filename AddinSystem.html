                    <h3 class=""><b>Addinsystem</b>: evaluating complex securities in realtime.</h3>
                    <p>When the analytics functionality was created in the 1990's, the essential requirement was
                        that the analytics needed to be available in realtime.  Curves had to be calibrated using market inputs and securities had to be 
                        evaluated using the latest prices. This was accomplished by wrapping the functionality in Excel addins, so we referred to the analytics as the AddinSystem.
                        <br>
                        One of the core strengths of the analytics is they incorporate all of the idiosyncratic features of the many securities that Rock Ridge Advisors
                        has encountered over the last 30 years.  
                        And if we find a new wrinkle, that wrinkle gets incorporated into the analytics in short order.

                            <p>RiskSim is designed for more than security analytics.  It is also designed to provide tools to aid in monitoring the
                                macroeconomic environment--which is critical give then impact of macroeconomic shifts on risk management.
                                A flexible set of price transformation, data containers and statistical methods enables this analysis.  
                                Given the noise in most economic series, we are usually more interest in transformations (e.g. first differences or 
                                log differences) of moving averages or other transformations of the raw data series (e.g. some moving average) than we are
                                in the raw data series itself.  It is common to want to perform some sort of eigensystem analyis or logit regression
                                to understand the implications of movements in economic data for risk management.

                            <p>While rate differentials have always been important in analysing investments in different currency, 
                                following the GFC (Great Financial Crisis), cross-currency basis has played a much more prominent role in determining
                                the relative attractiveness of investments in different currencies.  Currency-adjusted yields and spreads are
                                particularly important for investors who routinely hedge their exposures back into a base currency.
                                The Risksim methodology not only generates currency-adjusted rates and spreads, but can decompose the cashflows 
                                for security analysis and can break out the "fx carry" when performing P&L analysis.</p>
