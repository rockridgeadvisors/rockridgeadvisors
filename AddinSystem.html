                    <p class="px-2">When the analytics functionality was created in the 1990's, the essential requirement was
                        that the analytics needed to be available in realtime.  Curves had to be calibrated using market inputs and securities had to be 
                        evaluated using the latest prices. This was accomplished by wrapping the functionality in Excel addins, so we referred to the analytics as the AddinSystem.
                        <br>
                        One of the core strengths of the analytics is they incorporate all of the idiosyncratic features of the many securities that Rock Ridge Advisors
                        has encountered over the last 30 years.  
                        And if we find a new wrinkle, that wrinkle gets incorporated into the analytics in short order.

                            <p>For many purposes, having access to prices does not tell the whole story.  In fact, it is more common that we want to
                                track derivative measures such yields, spreads, default probabilities or analyze first differences, log differences or
                                percentage differences over arbitray time periods.  In addition, particularly for economic statistics, we want to 
                                use some sort of smoothing to dampen the noise by using moving averages or filters, such as the Hodrick-Prescott filter.
                                For example, the most useful transformation of jobless claims is the year-over-year percentage change in the 12-week
                                moving average.  The Hodrick-Prescott filter is used to smooth out the infamously volatile productivity series
                                to estimate trend productivity.  RiskSim makes it easy to analyze transformed data series.

                            <p>While rate differentials have always been important in analysing investments in different currency, 
                                following the GFC (Great Financial Crisis), cross-currency basis has played a much more prominent role in determining
                                the relative attractiveness of investments in different currencies.  Currency-adjusted yields and spreads are
                                particularly important for investors who routinely hedge their exposures back into a base currency.
                                The Risksim methodology not only generates currency-adjusted rates and spreads, but can decompose the cashflows 
                                for security analysis and can break out the "fx carry" when performing P&L analysis.
